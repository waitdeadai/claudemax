## [Unreleased]

### Changed — 2026-05-28 Opus 4.8 retarget (primary model + xhigh/ultracode tailoring)

Opus 4.8 shipped 2026-05-28. Verified live against [Anthropic's announcement](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-8), [models overview](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview), and the [Effort guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) (all accessed 2026-05-28). Pricing, context (1M), max output (128k), and cache structure are **unchanged** from 4.7 — only the model id and behavior tuning move.

- **Primary model `claude-opus-4-7` → `claude-opus-4-8`.** Single load-bearing pin in `packages/core/src/models.ts` (the `opus` tier id) + the `ModelId` union in `types.ts`; every runtime/CLI/skill site resolves Opus via `MODELS.opus.id`, so the whole pipeline retargets from these two literals. `.claude/settings.json` REPL pin bumped in lockstep. Opus strengths gain "honest self-review (4× fewer unflagged code flaws than 4.7)".
- **Era-aware default executor.** `execModelForVariant(variant, era)` now takes a billing era. In the **pre-split era** (until 2026-06-15) Opus and Sonnet share one 5h subscription pool, so the cost rationale for Sonnet execution evaporates — `opussonnet` (the `/cmax`/`/ask` default) executes sub-Specs on **Opus 4.8** for maximum effectiveness (4× fewer unflagged flaws, agentic coding 64.3→69.2). **Post-split** it auto-reverts to Sonnet. `run.ts` supplies the live era via `resolveBillingEra()`. `--variant opusolo` forces Opus every era; `--cheap`/explicit Sonnet remains the cost-conscious escape hatch. plan/decompose + verify stay Opus regardless (house rule #4, untouched).
- **`--effort {high|xhigh|max}` flag** on `cmax run`, threaded to the `runGoal` / `runTddCycle` execution lanes. Default stays **`xhigh`** — Anthropic's recommended tier for agentic/coding + long-running work, now vindicated for 4.8. **`max` is opt-in only**: measured ~3% gain over xhigh for ~2× tokens/pool burn, and it can *overthink* structured-output lanes (spec/verify), so it is never the standing default. `thinking` stays `adaptive` (4.8 rejects manual extended thinking with a 400).
- **`spec-writer.ts` effort pinned to `xhigh`** + `thinking: adaptive`. Previously set no effort, so under 4.8 it would silently fall to the SDK `high` default on a never-demote judgment lane.

### Fixed — 2026-05-28 (pre-existing pricing bugs surfaced by the 4.8 audit)

- **`packages/runtime/src/overnight.ts` `estimateUsd`** hardcoded legacy `$15/$75` Opus pricing — a 3× overcount that tripped the overnight budget loop early (harmless pre-split, wrong post-split). Now reads `MODELS.opus.{inputPer1MUsd,outputPer1MUsd}` ($5/$25) from the registry so it auto-tracks the catalog.
- **`docs/MODEL_ROUTING.md` tier-pricing table** had the same legacy `$15/$1.50/$75` Opus row — corrected to `$5/$0.50/$25`.

### Changed — 2026-05-28 docs/test sweep for 4.8

- Model-version prose refreshed to Opus 4.8 across `sdk-options.ts`, `orchestrator.ts`, `goal.ts`, `prompts.ts` (live worker system prompt), `plugin.json`, `README.md`, `skills/opusolo/SKILL.md`, and `docs/SOTA_2026.md` (largest cluster — re-pinned capability bullets, added an Opus-4.8 subsection covering Dynamic Workflows / fast mode / mid-task system messages / honesty gain, and resolved the stale "defaults to max" vs `xhigh` contradiction). `CLAUDE.md` billing-era date 2026-05-22 → 2026-05-28.
- Test prose + the coupled literal in `variant-routing.test.ts` (`opusolo` → `claude-opus-4-8`) bumped; added era-aware guards (opussonnet → Opus pre-split / Sonnet post-split). `cache.test.ts` + `store-sota.test.ts` prose → 4.8 (all numeric pricing/context assertions unchanged and still green). `pnpm build && typecheck && test` green.

### Deferred (flagged by the audit; need a dedicated pass, NOT auto-applied)

- **Dynamic Workflows as a `Mode C`** — routed through `/cc-audit` + `/harness-audit` instead of guessing an env flag (it auto-activates with 4.8; adding a third auto-selected parallelism arm changes house rule #7's two-mode contract).
- **Haiku verifier double-check** — kept opt-in/off-by-default; the 4.8 honesty gain weakens its original rationale, but replacing it with a second Opus pass reverses commit `5efecd4` and needs `/council` + ~30-run validation.
- **Version bump** (0.2.2 → 0.3.0) for this retarget — pending; touches root + plugin.json + 4 workspace packages + the OTEL/doctor version-assertion tests in lockstep.

### Added — 2026-05-22 daily-effectiveness improvement run (cmax orchestrate 5-lane)

- **`packages/runtime/src/agent-teams.ts` true parallel dispatch.** Mode B (Claude Code Agent Teams) sub-Specs now run in a DAG-aware bounded-parallel dispatcher instead of the sequential `for...await` loop. Independent leaves dispatch concurrently via `Promise.race(active)` over an active-set capped by `MAX_PARALLEL_AGENTS` (env) or `os.cpus().length`. Dependency chains from `multispec.dependencies` are honoured; cycle-stuck sub-Specs fail fast rather than deadlock. Closes the gap between CLAUDE.md rule #7's stated "max parallel by default" and Mode B's prior actual behaviour. `packages/runtime/tests/agent-teams.test.ts` adds N=4 parallelism smoke + DAG enforcement + maxParallel=2 cap + cycle handling, all using a `_spawnTeammate` injection to avoid spawning real `claude -p` subprocesses in CI.
- **`skills/specqa/SKILL.md`** ported from minmaxing v1 — spec quality gate; blocks `/goal` handoff when a completion condition lacks a mechanically-checkable verifyHint. Pairs with the multispec engine's auto-generated sub-Specs to catch weak hints before they waste a `/goal` run.
- **`skills/cc-audit/SKILL.md`** — SOTA-2026 deepresearch-backed audit of new Claude Code CLI releases. Pulls primary sources (canonical CHANGELOG.md, Anthropic docs, GH release notes), corroborates third-party signals (tweets, blogs, changelog mirrors), and emits per-change verdict (IGNORE / WRAP / INTEGRATE / DEFER). Caught this session: @ClaudeCodeLog tweet bot claimed 2.1.147 added a "Workflow tool (CLAUDE_CODE_WORKFLOWS=1)" — primary sources had no such entry; verdict was `unverified` and the harness skipped a fictitious integration.
- **`packages/cli/src/commands/doctor.ts` --hooks flag** — lists every wired Stop/Pre/Post hook from `~/.claude/settings.json` + `.claude/settings.json` with source path, plus the resolved `agentcloseout-physics` binary version. Default `cmax doctor` now also asserts `package.json` and `plugin.json` version consistency.
- **`scripts/bump-version.sh`** atomic helper for keeping `package.json` and `plugin.json` in lockstep on SemVer bumps.
- **`install.sh` + `install.ps1` shell-alias guidance** at end of install — surfaces the `alias claude='claude --dangerously-skip-permissions'` recommendation per shell (`~/.bashrc`/`~/.zshrc`/`~/.config/fish/config.fish`/`$PROFILE`) with copy-paste-ready commands. Does NOT auto-modify rc files. Eliminates the v0.2.x first-day friction documented in `plugin.json._schemaNote`.
- **`LICENSE` upgraded to canonical Apache-2.0 full text (202 lines).** GitHub's SPDX auto-detector now recognises the repo as `Apache-2.0` instead of `NOASSERTION` (verification post-push).

### Changed

- **`package.json` 0.2.0 → 0.2.2** and **`plugin.json` 0.2.1 → 0.2.2.** README and skill catalog already referenced v0.2.2 features (`/orchestrate`); the manifests now match. Future drift is gated by the new `cmax doctor` version-consistency check.

### Fixed

- **`packages/core/src/models.ts` pricing correction.** Opus 4.7 is **$5 input / $25 output per MTok** (verified 2026-05-20 against [Anthropic's models overview](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview)). v0.2.0 had the legacy Opus 4.5 prices baked in ($15/$75) — a 3× overestimate of Opus cost. Sonnet 4.6 ($3/$15) and Haiku 4.5 ($1/$5) were already correct. Per-packet cost estimates and plan-aware demote thresholds are now accurate.
- Context windows updated: Opus 4.7 = 1M, Sonnet 4.6 = 1M, Haiku 4.5 = 200k.
- Max output updated: Opus 4.7 = 128k, Sonnet 4.6 = 64k, Haiku 4.5 = 64k.

### Added

- Prompt-caching pricing constants per tier: `cacheWrite5mPer1MUsd` (1.25× base input), `cacheWrite1hPer1MUsd` (2× base input), `cachedInputPer1MUsd` (0.1× base input) per [Anthropic prompt caching docs](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching).
- `cacheStatsFromUsage(tier, usage)` helper in `packages/core/src/cost.ts` — surfaces hit rate, billed input, and $ saved vs counterfactual no-cache cost. Foundation for `cmax memory credit` cache-aware reporting.
- `AgentResult` gains `cacheReadTokens` and `cacheWriteTokens` optional fields.
- `estimatePacketCost` now assumes 50% of static input is cached on subsequent turns (per Anthropic's caching docs hit-rate guidance), giving more realistic estimates for multi-turn workflows.
- `docs/SOTA_2026.md` — live-research synthesis comparing claudemax to Anthropic Agent Teams, Ruflo (formerly claude-flow, 31k stars), wshobson/agents, Forge, Composio AO, and the broader 2026 multi-agent ecosystem. Includes adopted-vs-not SDK option matrix and open research questions.
- `SECURITY.md` subscription-compliance section — explicit note that claudemax routes through the Agent SDK credit pool, unaffected by the [April 4 2026 OpenClaw block](https://thenextweb.com/news/anthropic-openclaw-claude-subscription-ban-cost) which Anthropic [reversed](https://www.datagrom.com/ai-news/anthropic-reverses-ban-on-third-party-ai-agent-use-8ec3aaa6).
- `packages/core/tests/cache.test.ts` — 11 new tests covering verified pricing constants, cache-stats math, and cost-with-cache-writes arithmetic.

### Added — SOTA SDK alignment (all 7 follow-ups landed)

- `packages/runtime/src/sdk-options.ts` — centralized `baseSdkOptions()` builder + `EffortLevel` type + `estimateTaskBudgetTokens()` + `parseUsageWithCache()`. All `query()` call sites now spread the baseline through one helper so the SDK option set stays consistent.
- **`effort: 'xhigh'` is the new default** (Anthropic's recommended setting for Opus 4.7 coding per [release notes](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/whats-new-claude-4-7)). Users can still override to `'max'` via the runtime `effort` option or `--effort max` CLI flag.
- **`thinking: { type: 'adaptive' }` opt-in for reasoning roles.** Opus 4.7 ships adaptive thinking OFF by default. claudemax now explicitly enables it for `goal`, `verify`, and any opus-tier packet in the orchestrator.
- **`task_budget` beta wired.** When `maxBudgetUsd` is set, the runtime auto-computes a corresponding `task_budget.total` (per-tier token estimate) and sends it alongside the `task-budgets-2026-03-13` beta header. The model is AWARE of the budget countdown and self-paces — distinct from `maxBudgetUsd` which is a hard cap.
- **Opt-in SDK options exposed via `baseSdkOptions()`**: `includeHookEvents`, `strictMcpConfig`, `sessionStoreFlush: 'eager'` (the last enables near-real-time transcript mirror for live-tailing Mode B agent-teams).
- **Cache token tracking end-to-end.** `parseUsageWithCache()` extracts `cache_read_input_tokens` and `cache_creation.ephemeral_5m/1h_input_tokens` from result messages. `AgentResult` and `GoalRunResult` propagate `cacheReadTokens` / `cacheWriteTokens`. `RunRecord` persists them. `memory.runs` schema gains `cache_read_tokens` and `cache_write_tokens` columns (with idempotent forward migration for existing DBs).
- **`cmax memory credit` subcommand.** Shows current-period Agent SDK credit consumption (`formatPlanBudgetState`) AND prompt cache hit rate (`cacheStatsThisPeriod`). Warns if hit rate < 30% on > 100k input tokens (likely [SDK caching bug #188](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-typescript/issues/188)).
- **PACKET_AGENT_SYSTEM prompt updated** with explicit fan-out instruction. Opus 4.7's "fewer subagents spawned by default" behavior would otherwise serialize work; workers are now told to invoke the Agent tool multiple times in one assistant turn for parallel execution.
- **`docs/MCP_SERVERS.md`** — recommended MCP server configs for software-engineering power users: Playwright, Vercel, Supabase, GitHub, Figma, Slack, Postgres. Includes anti-recommendations and notes on `strictMcpConfig`.

### Tests

- `pnpm test` → 83 unit tests (44 core + 6 memory + 33 runtime).
- `bash scripts/smoke.sh` → 90 smoke checks (added 3 for `memory credit` subcommand).
- All green locally; CI green on push.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-20

Major rewrite: Anthropic-only, multispec engine as the default daily-driver, two parallelism modes (SDK subagents + Claude Code Agent Teams), plan-aware cost-guard tuned for Claude Max subscribers, taste auto-bootstrap via /deepresearch, full remote-from-phone operation stack.

### Added — multispec engine + parallelism

- `packages/runtime/src/multispec.ts` — flagship pipeline: `/deepresearch` → multispec decomposition → `/specqa` → `/introspect` → parallel `/goal` per DAG leaf → per-sub-spec `/verify` → rollup `/verify`. Default behavior of every umbrella (no `--multi` flag).
- `packages/runtime/src/agent-teams.ts` — Mode B driver wrapping Claude Code Agent Teams (experimental v2.1.32) with shared task list + worktree isolation per teammate. Auto-selected when sub-spec count > 5 OR estimated duration > 30 min OR cross-spec coordination required OR overlapping write sets.
- `packages/runtime/src/orchestrator.ts` refactored — Mode A (SDK subagents in one `query()` session with `agents:` map) is default. New `computeParallelCap()` takes min of hardware cap (3 / 6 / 10) and credit-aware cap (`floor((remaining credit / per-packet) * 0.3)`).

### Added — subscription-first billing

- `packages/runtime/src/billing.ts` — `detectPlan()` reads `CMAX_PLAN` env, falls back to `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` presence, falls back to probing `claude config get plan`. Default plan: `max5x` when nothing is detected.
- `packages/core/src/cost.ts` — `MONTHLY_CREDIT_USD` per plan (Max20x $200, Max5x $100, Pro $20, api null). `formatCost()` produces dual format ("$X • Y% of $Z monthly credit"). `budgetTag()` thresholds: < 70% ok, 70-90% guard, 90-95% danger, > 95% blocked. Identical for both Max tiers.
- `packages/core/src/router.ts` — plan-aware demotion: at guard / danger / blocked, demote non-essential Opus → Sonnet. `verify` / `spec` / `architect` are in NEVER_DEMOTE and stay Opus regardless. `RouteDecision` gains `demoted` field alongside `escalated`.

### Added — auto-bootstrap taste (no 10-question wizard)

- `packages/runtime/src/taste.ts` — reads repo signals (README + package manifest + framework detection) → `/deepresearch` SOTA for the detected domain at *current time* → Opus synthesizes `taste.md` + `taste.vision` with zero questions. One fallback question only when the repo has no signal.
- `cmax taste init` CLI command.

### Added — new runtime modules

- `packages/runtime/src/deepresearch.ts` — parallel WebSearch + WebFetch with source ledger, `outputFormat: json_schema` for structured ResearchBrief.
- `packages/runtime/src/hive.ts` — N parallel proposers + Opus merger.
- `packages/runtime/src/council.ts` — 3-Opus adversarial debate (proposer / critic / judge).
- `packages/runtime/src/agent-factory.ts` — Hermes-style AgentDefinition registry at `agents/registry.json`.
- `packages/runtime/src/overnight.ts` — long-running mode with file checkpointing + session resumption + budget cap.

### Added — remote operation stack

- `cmax bg setup --projects ...` — creates tmux session 'claudemax' with one window per project.
- `cmax bg status` — live probe of tmux, Tailscale (with hostname), curl, NTFY_TOPIC, claude CLI.
- `cmax bg phone` — phone-side onboarding with QR codes (when `qrencode` available) for ntfy deep link, Tailscale download, Termius (iOS), Termux (Android). Auto-generates `NTFY_TOPIC` and persists to `~/.claudemax-state/config.json`.
- `cmax bg kill` — clean teardown of the tmux session.
- `.claude/hooks/cmax-stop.sh` — ntfy.sh push notification on every claudemax run completion; reads `NTFY_TOPIC` from env or global config; includes project name + file-change count.
- `docs/REMOTE_OPERATION.md` — full evidence-based setup guide (Tailscale + Termius/Termux + tmux + ntfy + voice).
- `setup.sh` (rewritten) — auto-installs tmux + qrencode + Tailscale via apt/brew/dnf/pacman with sudo confirms, builds + symlinks `cmax`, generates `NTFY_TOPIC`, prints phone-side QR codes, runs `cmax doctor` + `cmax bg status`.

### Added — new CLI commands

- `cmax run` — multispec pipeline always on. Flags: `--variant {opussonnet|opusolo}`, `--mode {auto|solo|teams}`, `--no-research`, `--no-verify`.
- `cmax doctor` — billing mode + parallel cap + auth surface introspection.
- `cmax research <topic>` — `/deepresearch` standalone; persists sources to `memory.research_sources`.
- `cmax overnight <spec> --budget-credits N` — long-running mode.
- `cmax config get / set / list / path` — project-level config.
- `cmax taste init` — auto-bootstrap.
- `cmax bg {setup|status|phone|kill}` — remote orchestration.

### Added — 29 active skills (audited for overlap)

5 umbrellas: `/ask`, `/cmax`, `/workflow` (alias), `/opussonnet` (alias), `/opusolo`.
5 research: `/deepresearch`, `/audit`, `/investigate`, `/codesearch`, `/introspect`.
2 planning: `/spec`, `/specqa`.
5 execution: `/goal`, `/tdd`, `/parallel`, `/hive`, `/council`.
3 verification: `/verify`, `/review`, `/ship`.
3 memory/state: `/memory`, `/align`, `/overnight`.
2 taste: `/taste`, `/deepretaste`.
4 infrastructure: `/agentfactory`, `/route`, `/agentteams`, `/harness-audit`.
Plus 1 deprecated stub: `/dispatch` (use `/parallel` or `cmax dispatch` instead).

### Added — memory schema extensions

`research_sources`, `taste_history`, `sub_specs` tables. `runs` gains `plan` + `mode` columns. New `creditConsumedThisPeriod()` rollup.

### Added — dark-patterns hooks integration

`.claude/settings.json` enables `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=true`; `.claude/DARK_PATTERNS_INSTALL.md` documents install of `waitdeadai/llm-dark-patterns` (35 hooks: no-vibes, no-emoji-spam, no-aggregator-hallucination, honest-eta, no-fake-cite, etc.).

### Added — brand assets

`assets/avatar.svg` (512×512 hex agent-mesh), `assets/wordmark.svg` (banner), `assets/icon-mono.svg` (favicon). Electric cyan `#00E5FF` on deep-ink `#0A0E1A`. Non-infringement notes in `assets/README.md`.

### Added — docs

`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `MULTISPEC.md`, `PARALLELISM.md`, `AGENT_TEAMS.md`, `WORKFLOW_VARIANTS.md`, `SKILL_CATALOG.md`, `TASTE_AUTOBOOTSTRAP.md`, `V1_TO_V2_MIGRATION.md`, `REMOTE_OPERATION.md`, updated `MODEL_ROUTING.md` / `GOAL_PIPELINE.md` / `QUICKSTART.md` / `README.md` / `CLAUDE.md`.

### Changed

- Dropped `@anthropic-ai/sdk` dependency entirely. All provider calls route through `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` `query()` so they bill against the Agent SDK credit pool (separate from interactive usage since Anthropic's June 15 2026 billing split).
- `goal.ts` / `verify.ts` / `spec-writer.ts` / `orchestrator.ts` all opt into native SDK features: `settingSources: ['user', 'project']`, `skills: 'all'`, `effort: 'max'`, `fallbackModel: 'claude-sonnet-4-6'`, `enableFileCheckpointing`, `agentProgressSummaries`, `forwardSubagentText`, `abortController`, `outputFormat: { type: 'json_schema', schema }`.
- Multispec is the default behavior of every umbrella; the legacy single-spec `cmax spec` + `cmax goal` flow remains for low-level use.

### Removed

- v1's MiniMax integration paths entirely (no `/opusminimax`, `/sonnetminimax`).
- Skills that overlapped or duplicated functionality: `/webresearch` (merged into `/deepresearch`), `/autoplan` (merged into multispec engine), `/qa` (merged into `/verify`), `/tastebootstrap` (replaced by `/taste` auto-bootstrap), `/sonnetonly` / `/hiveworkflow` / `/opusworkflow` (overlap with `/opussonnet`).
- `/digestaste`, `/digestflow` as user-facing skills — they're internal runtime functions used by hooks.

### Tests

72 unit + 67 smoke = 139 local checks passing.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-20

Initial scaffold. pnpm monorepo (`packages/core`, `packages/runtime`, `packages/memory`, `packages/cli`) + 7 skills + 4 docs. Router with rule-based escalation/demotion. Spec writer + /goal driver + blind Opus verifier wired to `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`. SQLite + FTS5 memory store. CLI binary `cmax`. Released alongside this session — superseded by 0.2.0 the same day.
